Create a simple program that checks if a shop is open or closed.
Create a variable hour that stores the current hour (0â€“23).
The shop is open between 9 and 20 (inclusive).

If the shop is open, log:
"Shop is open"
If the shop is closed, log:
"Shop is closed"

Challenge: Try writing it using a ternary operator instead of if-else.
