<!--
Continuing from exercise5, Instead of displaying 'heads' or 'tails' in the console, save the result in a variable called 'result'.
Let's say we're trying to guess the result. Create a variable called 'guess' and save your guess ('heads' or 'tails').
If your guess matches the result, display 'You win!' in the console
If your guess does not match the result, display 'You lose!'
