<!--
Continuing from exercise3, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.

Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
