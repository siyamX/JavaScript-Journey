<!--
Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount.
If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.

Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
